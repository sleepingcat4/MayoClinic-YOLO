# MayoClinic-YOLO
An Object detection program for classifying images for MayoClinic Challenge

Above code implementation of YOLOV3 is based upon Darknet Github repo. (YOLO Authors)

I have created an Keras implementation of YOLO V3 using Darknet repo. Before using the repo and it's code download the yolo-v3 model weights from here and place it in your wokring
directory. [LINK] (https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

Place an issue, if you find any errors within the code
